    <p class="concept">Picard as Locutus was cloned in a transporter accident, then both Picards had their Borg implants removed. Now one goes by Jean-Luc and the other by Larry. But which is which? And what do they remember?</p>

    <p>Picard &amp; Picard, the Philadelphia-based duo of Carlos Cotallo Solares (guitar, electronics; born in Spain) and Jeffrey Young (violin, electronics; born in NYC), moves between dreamy electro-acoustic soundscapes and harsh, deliberate noise, drawing on their backgrounds as improvisers and composers.</p>

    <p>Carlos and Jeffrey met in Philadelphia playing in the Arcana Open Sound Workshop, an ongoing project of <a href="https://www.bowerbird.org/">Bowerbird</a>'s <a href="https://www.arcananewmusic.org/">Arcana New Music Ensemble</a> that served as a space for contemporary classical musicians to explore and develop open score pieces. They began working as a duo in March 2020, just before the start of the coronavirus lockdowns, and their first public concerts were performed over Zoom, with the two musicians calling in from their separate apartments across the city.</p>
